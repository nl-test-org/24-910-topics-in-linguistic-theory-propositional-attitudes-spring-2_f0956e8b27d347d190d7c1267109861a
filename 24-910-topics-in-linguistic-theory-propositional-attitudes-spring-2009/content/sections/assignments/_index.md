Papers
------

Papers 1 and 2 should be 5-8 pages each of double-spaced text on different topics related to the course material. Paper 3 is a substantial revision of either Paper 1 or Paper 2 and should be 7-10 pages long. For general guidelines about writing philosophy papers, please refer to [Guidelines on Writing a Philosophy Paper](http://www.jimpryor.net/teaching/guidelines/writing.html).

Presentations
-------------

The two presentations related to Papers 1 and 2 will take place one week before that paper is due so that you have the opportunity to receive feedback on your arguments. The final presentation will be for the third (revised) paper. Presentations should be 5 minutes long.

Homework Exercises
------------------

These assignments are in addition to writing the papers and preparing the presentations. Solutions are available for selected assignments below.
